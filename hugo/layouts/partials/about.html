    Hello, I'm Abu, and I am basically a professional problem solver, but with fewer capes and more coffee. 
    
    I write code that (mostly) works and occasionally breaks things. If I'm not debugging, Iâ€™m probably debugging my life. My hobbies include fixing bugs, making features, and pretending I understand all those error messages.
